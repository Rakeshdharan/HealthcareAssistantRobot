> PROBLEM STATEMENT

- Doctors and other _HealthCare Workers (HCWs)_ are the *frontline* and first point of contact in a ***patientâ€™s
health care.***

- While the whole country is fighting against the `COVID-19 crisis`, the ones on the frontline, doctors and
other healthcare workers, are working excruciatingly hard for the 'welfare of the patients' and also to minimise the damage to the society due to the pandemic.

- However, the threat of them being affected by the disease and infecting their own families looms large over
them. Shortage of `Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)` and lack of definite cure are factors which adds fuel to the fire.
